# Online-Media-Post-Text-Classification

In this project we explore the dataset, design 5 machine learning methods to classify tweets as fake or real and evaluate each methods.

The dataset chosen for this project is taken from: http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2015/. 

Aims:
  1. Evaluate a set of possible machine learning algorithm designs to classify posts within the MediaEval 2015 "verifying multimedia use" dataset.
  2. Critically analyse the use case (task and data) and identify five possible algorithms designs. Each algorithm design will include a choice of pre-processing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction technique(s) and machine learning algorithm.
